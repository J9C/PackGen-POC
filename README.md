# BACKGROUND INFORMATION

ngl one of my friends sent me this kinda cringe video of this PackGen, which is not all that hard to make, yes it may look cleaner, have more features, etc
but this is just a POC, i'll add more shit later when i feel like it, since im not getting paid im only gonna work on this during my free time so don't expect
anything more than a few updates per week.

# WHAT IS A POC?

a poc is a proof of concept basically telling you that the script works and functions properly and how you can go on about doing so, this is how I made mine,
if you know what you're doing then you can use what I made as a refrence

# REQUIREMENTS

pip install random

# HOW I MADE THIS

the first thing that i did was make a world list

then after that I created a small script using mainanswer to put these random word's into a complete sentence
